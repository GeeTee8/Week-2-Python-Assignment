# Python List Operations

## Description
This Python script demonstrates basic list operations, including creating a list, adding elements, inserting elements at specific positions, extending the list with another list, removing elements, sorting, and finding the index of a specific value.

It is designed as a beginner-friendly example for understanding how Python lists work.

## Features
- Create an empty list
- Append elements to a list
- Insert an element at a specific position
- Extend the list with multiple elements from another list
- Remove the last element
- Sort the list in ascending order
- Find and display the index of a specific value

## Code Flow
1. **Create** an empty list called `my_list`.
2. **Append** `10, 20, 30, 40` to the list.
3. **Insert** the value `15` at index `1`.
4. **Extend** the list with `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. **Remove** the last element using `.pop()`.
6. **Sort** the list in ascending order.
7. **Find** and print the index of the value `30`.
8. **Display** the final list.
